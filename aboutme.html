<h1>Adam here!</h1>
<p>Hello, <strong>my name</strong> is Adam. I <strong>grew up</strong> in a small city on the east coast of the Java island, called Gresik. Albeit being such a small city, I don't think I am the only one from the city to have studied at Harvard. Oh, my major is <strong>software engineering</strong>. Now, having some arguably advanced experience with backend development, I want to delve deeper into the world of front end development.</p>
